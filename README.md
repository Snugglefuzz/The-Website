# The-Website

Final Project for Front-End Dev CPSC 349.

It is a website built for a Freelancing Prinny looking to get a job
as a Youtube Editor. There is a Home Page that introduces a Prinny named Snuggie.
The Previous Work page, is a video gallery of videos he helped make in the past.
Followed by a Contact Page with information on where you may contact Snuggie.

Overall, it is a simple website. Mostly used CCS for styling, and some javascript
to dynamically load videos in the video gallery.
